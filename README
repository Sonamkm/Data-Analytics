Aspiring Data Analyst skilled in Python, Power BI, SQL, and storytelling with data. Passionate about using analytics to uncover meaningful insights and solve

across different domains.

I also write about my data projects and insights on [Medium](https://medium.com/@sonam.m17), aiming to make analytics approachable for beginners and non-technical 
readers.
